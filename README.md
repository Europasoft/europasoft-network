### Multithreaded, cross-platform, high-performance C++ networking library.<br/>
All functionality is available for both Windows and Linux.

This aims to provide convenient TCP and UDP capabilities. 

## Examples
The file Networking.cpp contains an example main function. Use this to quickly run the examples located in Source/Examples. Replace this with your own code if you wish to use the library for other purposes.

## Building
- ### Windows / Windows-Linux combined build
  The provided code can be built in Visual Studio for Windows, or remotely targeting a Linux machine (or VM).<br/>
  Project files are included for this purpose, with a separate project folder for targeting linux.<br/>A guide to remote Linux debugging can be [found here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/linux/create-a-new-linux-project).
- ### Linux
