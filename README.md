# Networking
Multithreaded, cross-platform (Windows/Linux) high-performance C++ networking library

The goal for this API is to have a minimal cross-compilable codebase that is easy to integrate with other project, and provides indentical perfomance for both Windows and UNIX systems.
Windows-Server to Windows-Client is at a stable alpha version. Linux interop is currently untested and requires minor modifications.
